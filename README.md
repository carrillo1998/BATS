This GitHub contains the scripts for data analysis done on the paper titled Sub-daily Bermuda Atlantic Time Series virus sampling reveals taxonomy, host, and functional differences at the population, but not community level.

You will find the scripts in the script folder and the input files in the Supplemental Files folder. Some of these inputs will be generated through the scripts and have been placed here for ease of access.
